# Dataset:

In this dataset we go through the Ford GoBike System Data which represents the data of a bike-sharing company. This dataset originally contains 16  features but  we added more columns  later.
The whole  work  done on this Dataset is divided  into  parts:
In the first part,  we gathered and assessed the data,  In the second part, the  cleansing part is  done  by removing the NULL values,  the duplicates, changing  some column types and  adding more columns to  ease the exploration process. In the third part, the Univariate data  exploration was performed then the BIvariate exploration  to  find the relations  between the features. Lastly, the Multicariate exploration  was performed to  have a deeper look on how many  features are connected and related.

# Summary of Findings:

1)  age of the  users  affects the  counts of the trips made and  most of the users  are between  25 and  35  years old


2) Gender: males  teend to make more  trips compared  to females and  other   gender types, On the other hand, other gender types tend to spend more  time in  their  duration  followed by  females and then males.

3) Trip starting  day: users  tend to have more  trips in  the weekdays  compared  to weekends with max  trip  counts on  Thursday, however, people tend to have more  trip durations  in the weekends  compared  to  the weekdays

4) Trip starting  hour: the number of trips tend to be maximized in the rush   hours during the weekdays,namely  5pm then 8 am then  6  pm and  so on.

5) user type: most of the  trip counts are made by the subscribers, however, the  customers  tend to spend  more trip duration  compared to the  subscribers

# Key Insights for Presentation:


1) the plot of the  duration  distribution is  right skewed and  we may needa  log transformation  to make it  normally distributed in the presentation

2)  checking the features affecting the  bike rides' counts  such as  gender, user type and  start day  and hour

3)  checking the  features that  affect the  dration of the  rides
